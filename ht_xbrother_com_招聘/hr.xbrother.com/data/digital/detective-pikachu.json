Using Snapchat studio, I created a lens, that activated when fans 'snapped' the poster. Using <b>Augmented Reality</b> real-time effects overlaid the poster. These included flickering neon signs and lights, and ambient steam rising from the city streets. The interactive poster also featured an exclusive video clip that could be unlocked and watched, revealing unseen content, for the upcoming film.</p><p>Video courtesy of Oblio.
